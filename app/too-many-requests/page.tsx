// This file is part of the "Too Many Requests" page.
// It handles the scenario where a user has made too many requests in a short period of time.
// The Page component displays a message indicating the issue and provides a button to go back to the home page or sign-in page based on the user's authentication status.
// It uses the auth function to check if the user is authenticated.
// If the user is authenticated, the button redirects them to the home page;
// otherwise, it redirects them to the sign-in page.
// The page is styled with a main container that centers the content and displays a message and a
const Page = async () => {
  //Get user login status
  const session = await auth();
